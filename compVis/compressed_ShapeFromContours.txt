Shape from X

• One image:
• Texture
• Shading

• Two images or more:
• Stereo
• Contours
• Motion

Edge-Based Stereo

Matching edges yields stereo information but
• Potential ambiguities
• Edge detection is unreliable
2

EARLY STEREO APPROACH

Original segments

Matched segments

• Pro:
▪ Little computational power required.
• Con:
▪ Very ambiguous.
• Partial remedy:
▪ Use three or more images to disambiguate.

Modeling a Building

• The deformable model
encodes the endpoints of
the segments.
• Once it has been adjusted,
the 3D shape of the
building is known.

Different Types of Contours
Depth discontinuity contours

Occluding contour

• Depth discontinuity contours have well defined 3D locations.
• Occluding contours do not and depend on viewpoint.
7

Occluding Contours

Silhouettes let us carve the space:
• on one side is the object,
• on the other empty space.
8

Line of Sight

The line of sight is tangent to the surface. At one point at
least:
• The distance to the line of sight is zero
• The surface normal is perpendicular to it.
9

Combining Stereo and Silhouettes

• Using stereo only, the sides of the face are not accurately
reconstructed.
• This can be improved by using the silhouettes.
10

Combining Stereo and Silhouettes

—> Accurate 3D reconstruction even from very low resolution
noisy images.
11

Augmented Reality

• Track feature points on page
• Fit page boundary
• Detect and use silhouettes when they appear.
• Replace original texture.
12

Robustness to Occlusions

• Because we use several sources of information
simultaneously, the algorithm is robust to occlusions.
• This is a general principle. In a practical algorithm,
you want redundancy.

Visual Hull from One Image

• Silhouettes let us carve the space, on one side is
the object and on the other empty space.
• A closed image contour defines a cone inside which
the object must be.
• Everything else can be safely removed.
17

Visual Hull from Two Images

The object must be within the intersection of the two cones
defined by each individual silhouette.

Using Silhouettes

• Shapes inside the visual hull and such
that the VH surface is tangent along
viewing edges.
• Better approximation of the observed
object shape.

Decalibrating

When the cameras are ill calibrated:
• the cones become inconsistent,
• the visual hull becomes smaller.

Maximizing the Overlap

When the cameras are well calibrated the overlap of the
reprojected visual hull and the original silhouettes is largest.

Color Consistency

• Define a 3D grid that encloses the object.
• Each voxel in this grid that lies on the image should project to
image points that have the same color.
• This makes it possible to assign to each voxel a “color consistency”
score.
41

Silhouette Consistency

The line of sight is tangent to the surface. At one point at
least:
• The distance to the line of sight is zero
