Computer Vision
Goal: Inferring the properties of the world from one or
more images
• Photographs
• Video Sequences
• Medical images
• Microscopy data
 Image Understanding

Challenges
Vision involves dealing with:
• Noisy images
• Many-to-one mapping
• Aperture problem
 Requires:
• Assumptions about the world
• Statistical and physics-based models
• Training data
True image understanding seems to require a great deal of
thinking. We are not quite there yet.

Opportunities

C

ameras are becoming ever more prevalent and
Deep networks have immensely boosted the
performance of Computer Vision algorithms:

• Tremendous potential for applications.
• A window on the way the mind works.
• But limited understanding of why things work.
➡ Still much work to be done !!!!
➡ Lots of jobs in Switzerland and elsewhere.
