Neural Radiance Fields

A. Sampling 5D coordinates---location x, y, z and viewing direction θ, ϕ---along camera rays.
B. Feeding those locations into an MLP to produce a color and volume density.
C. Using volume rendering techniques to composite these values into an image.
D. Optimizing scene representation by minimizing the residual between synthesized and ground truth images.

Physically Inspired Volume Rendering
For a ray r(t) = o + td, the rendered color can be
computed as

Thresholding the Density

• Surfaces obtained by thresholding the density
• Choosing the threshold can be problematic

• Volume density is expressed a function of an SDF
• The reconstructed surfaces are smoother
