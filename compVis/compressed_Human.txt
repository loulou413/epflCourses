It Works!!
-->Proof of existence.
• The image formation process is well understood
• The image understanding one remains mysterious

Image Formation

An inverted image forms on the retina.

Perspective Projection

bc/d=b’c’/d’
• This is known as the pinhole camera model.
• Cameras do something similar and we will revisit it in the next lecture.

Rods and Cones

Rods: Low-intensity light vision,
e.g. night vision.
Cones: Color-vision with higher
intensity light.

• Red sand has been blown onto the slopes.
• The streak of snow in the middle should be white.

Peripheral Vs Foveal Vision

Much higher concentration of cells on the Fovea
!Active vision:
• We find objects using our peripheral vision
• We concentrate our gaze on objects of interest.

The Human Eye In Short
The Retina:
• rods (low-intensity light, night vision)
• cones (color-vision)
• Synapses and ganglions
• Optic nerve fibers
Sensing and low-level processing layer:
• 125 millions rods and cones feed into 1 million
nerve fibers

Primary Visual Cortex (V1)

• Largest area in the visual cortex.
• 100 times as many neurons as
retinal ganglion cells
! Overcomplete representation.

19

From V1 to the Others
To pathways originate from V1:
• The “where” pathway: V1→V2→V5→parietal lobe.
• The “what” pathway: V1→V2→V3→V4→temporal lobe.
Motion Detection and Object Recognition are mostly performed in
parallel but interconnections exist.
parietal lobe

temporal lobe

Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)

Receives feedbacks from V1 and V2. There is ten times
more feedback than feedforward sent to V1.

Stereoscopical Vision

Our brain is wired for stereo vision:
• Redundancy
• Depth perception

23

Optical Illusions

• Every image is the image of thing merely to him who
knows how to read it, and who is enabled by the aid of
the image to form an idea of the thing.
Handbook of Physiological Optics
H. von Helmholtz

Controlled Hallucination?

Perhaps, but very cleverly implemented in “wetware”.
!

How can we emulate it in hardware?

25

Recognize And Classify Animal vs No Animal
• Subjects must raise their hand if they see an
animal:
• 60 images
• 1 image per second

•!

Measure their reaction time.

Recurrent Pathways

“Shape stimuli are optimally reinforcing each other when separated in time by ∼60 ms,
suggesting an underlying recurrent circuit with a time constant (feedforward + feedback)
of 60 ms.”
Drewes et al. , Journal of Neuroscience, 2016

Human vs Computer Vision
The camera replaces the eye:

• Eye lens

-> Camera optics

• Cones and rods -> Sensor array
• Ganglion cells

-> Filter banks

The computer replaces the brain:
But how?
